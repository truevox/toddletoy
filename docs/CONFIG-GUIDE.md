## 🌍 Language Selection

ToddleToy supports learning in multiple languages simultaneously! This is one of its most powerful features.

### How Language Selection Works

**Two columns**:
1. **Enabled Languages** (left): Languages that will be spoken and displayed
2. **Available Languages** (right): Languages you can add

**How to add/remove languages**:
- **Drag**: Drag language cards between columns
- **Tap/Click**: Tap a language to move it between columns

### Language Order Matters!
The **first language** in your enabled list is the **primary language**. When ToddleToy speaks, it says the primary language first.

**Example**:
- If English is first: "Dog" then "Perro"
- If Spanish is first: "Perro" then "Dog"

### Why Use Multiple Languages?

**Bilingual benefits**:
- Early language exposure is proven to boost cognitive development
- Children learn languages more easily at young ages
- Builds cultural awareness and appreciation
- Creates lifelong language learning advantages

**How children experience it**:
When an object appears, your child hears it in all enabled languages:
- 🐶 "Dog... Perro... Chien" (English → Spanish → French)

This natural repetition helps children associate the same object with different words!

### Language Difficulty Levels

Each language shows a difficulty level to help you make informed choices:

- **Trivial**: Esperanto (designed to be easy to learn)
- **Easy**: Indonesian, Spanish
- **Medium**: Portuguese, French, English
- **Hard**: Lojban, Russian
- **Very Hard**: Bengali, Hindi
- **Extreme**: Klingon (fun constructed language!)
- **Expert Only**: Arabic, Mandarin Chinese

**Note**: These difficulty ratings are for adult learners. Young children can absorb multiple languages more easily than adults, especially when exposure starts early!

### Available Languages

- 🇺🇸 **English**: Default language, widely spoken globally
- 🇪🇸 **Spanish (Español)**: Second most common native language worldwide
- 🇨🇳 **Mandarin Chinese (中文)**: Most spoken language by native speakers
- 🇮🇳 **Hindi (हिन्दी)**: Official language of India
- 🇸🇦 **Arabic (العربية)**: Spoken across Middle East and North Africa
- 🇫🇷 **French (Français)**: Widely spoken in Europe, Africa, and Canada
- 🇧🇩 **Bengali (বাংলা)**: Language of Bangladesh and West Bengal
- 🇵🇹 **Portuguese (Português)**: Language of Portugal, Brazil, and more
- 🇷🇺 **Russian (Русский)**: Largest native language in Europe
- 🇮🇩 **Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia)**: Official language of Indonesia
- ⚔️ **Klingon (tlhIngan Hol)**: Fun Star Trek language!
- 🤖 **Lojban**: Constructed logical language
- ⭐ **Esperanto**: International auxiliary language designed for ease of learning

### Recommendations by Age

**Ages 1-2**: Start with 1-2 languages (usually the languages spoken at home)
**Ages 2-3**: Can handle 2-3 languages comfortably
**Ages 3-4**: Ready for 3-4 languages with regular exposure
**Ages 4+**: Can manage multiple languages, especially with consistent practice

**Important**: The key is **consistent exposure**, not number of languages. Better to use 2 languages regularly than 5 languages rarely!

## ⚙️ Special Number Displays (Advanced Section)

ToddleToy can show numbers in multiple ways at the same time! This helps children understand that the same quantity can be represented differently - a foundational math concept.

### How It Works
When a number appears, it shows:
1. The number in different ancient or alternative systems (at the top)
2. The regular number (in the middle)
3. The spoken word in enabled languages (at the bottom)

All representations show **the same number** - just written differently!

### ⚙️ Cistercian Numerals
**What it is**: An ancient number system used by medieval monks in monasteries (13th-15th centuries).

**How it works**:
- Uses geometric symbols that combine to form numbers 0-9999
- One symbol can represent an entire 4-digit number!
- Based on a vertical line with marks in different positions

**Educational value**:
- Shows that different cultures invented different number systems
- Demonstrates that math is a human invention
- Pattern recognition and visual-spatial skills
- Historical awareness

**Example**: The number 1234 becomes a single geometric symbol with marks for thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.

**Recommended for**: Ages 4+ who are curious about how numbers work and enjoy puzzles

**When to disable**: If it's confusing or overwhelming for very young learners

### ❄️ Kaktovik Numerals
**What it is**: A base-20 number system created by Inuit people in Kaktovik, Alaska (1990s) for teaching math in Iñupiaq language.

**How it works**:
- Uses geometric symbols where each symbol represents 0-19
- Visual representation shows groups of 5 (matching how we count on fingers!)
- Reflects how Iñupiaq language counts in base-20

**Educational value**:
- Indigenous mathematical systems and cultural respect
- Alternative ways to think about counting and grouping
- Base-20 vs base-10 number systems
- Cultural diversity in mathematics

**Example**: Numbers show geometric patterns that group by fives and twenties.

**Recommended for**: All ages - helps children understand that not everyone counts the same way

**Cultural note**: Using Kaktovik numerals honors Indigenous mathematical innovations and shows children that math exists across all cultures.

### ❤️ Binary Hearts
**What it is**: The number system computers use, displayed with hearts (❤️ = 1, 🤍 = 0).

**How it works**:
- Each position represents a power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32...)
- Hearts (❤️) mean "yes" or 1
- White hearts (🤍) mean "no" or 0

**Educational value**:
- Introduction to how computers think
- Pattern recognition
- Powers of two
- Foundation for computer science concepts
- Binary counting and logic

**Examples**:
- 5 = 🤍❤️🤍❤️ (4 + 0 + 1 = 5)
- 7 = 🤍❤️❤️❤️ (4 + 2 + 1 = 7)

**Recommended for**: Ages 4+ who are curious about computers and technology

**When to disable**: For very young children (1-2) who are just learning to count

### 🔢 Counting Modes

You can choose between two different ways to visually count:

#### 🔢 Object Counting (Place Values)
**What it is**: Uses different objects to represent ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands:
- 🍎 (Apple) = 1
- 🛍️ (Shopping Bag) = 10
- 📦 (Box) = 100
- 🚛 (Truck) = 1000

**How it works**:
- Number 5: Shows 5 apples (🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎)
- Number 15: Shows 1 shopping bag + 5 apples (🛍️🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎)
- Number 234: Shows 2 boxes + 3 shopping bags + 4 apples

**Educational value**:
- **Place value concept**: Understanding that position matters (234 vs 342)
- **Grouping**: How we group by 10s, 100s, 1000s
- **Foundation for addition/subtraction**: Visual representation of "carrying" and "borrowing"
- **Real-world math**: Like counting money (pennies, dimes, dollars)

**Recommended for**: Ages 4+ learning place values and preparing for multi-digit math

#### 🍎 Only Apples Counting
**What it is**: Simple counting where each number shows that many apples.

**How it works**:
- Number 3: 🍎🍎🍎
- Number 5: 🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎
- Number 7: 🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎

**Educational value**:
- **One-to-one correspondence**: Each apple = one count
- **Visual counting**: Seeing quantity represented visually
- **Subitizing**: Recognizing quantities without counting each item
- **Simple and clear**: No confusion about place values

**Recommended for**: Ages 2-4 who are learning to count and recognize quantities

**Note**: Only Apples works well up to about 20. Beyond that, it becomes hard to count all the apples, which is why we have Object Counting mode for larger numbers!

## 🧹 Auto-Cleanup Timer

**What it is**: Objects automatically disappear if they haven't been touched for a while.

**How it works**:
1. Each object gets its own invisible timer
2. When you touch, click, or interact with an object, its timer resets to zero
3. If the timer reaches the set time without any interaction, the object disappears with fun effects!

### ⏰ Enable Auto-Cleanup Checkbox
**What it does**: Turns the auto-cleanup feature on or off.

**When to enable**:
- Your child tends to spawn many objects and the screen gets crowded
- You want to encourage focus on current objects
- Teaching the concept of "paying attention" to active toys
- Preventing screen clutter during longer play sessions

**When to disable**:
- Your child likes to look at all their creations together
- Learning sessions are short (under 5 minutes)
- Your child gets upset when things disappear

### ⏱️ Timer Duration Setting
**What it controls**: How many seconds an object can sit untouched before disappearing.

**Setting range**: 5-300 seconds (5 seconds to 5 minutes)

**Recommended settings**:
- **5-10 seconds**: Active, fast-paced play; encourages quick interactions
- **15-30 seconds**: Balanced; gives time to explore but prevents clutter
- **60-120 seconds**: Relaxed play; plenty of time to look and think
- **180-300 seconds**: Very relaxed; objects stay a long time

**What happens when the timer expires**:
- 🎆 Fun firework particle effects
- 🎵 Cute "pop" sound
- ✨ Object disappears smoothly

**Educational value**:
- Cause and effect (touching resets the timer)
- Attention and focus
- Sense of time passing
- Managing on-screen clutter

---

## 🔊 Audio & Voice Controls

ToddleToy has two separate audio systems. Understanding the difference helps you configure them perfectly!

### 🎵 Audio Tones (Position-Based Sounds)

**What it is**: Musical tones that play based on where objects are positioned on the screen.

**How it works**:
- **Vertical position**: Controls pitch (higher on screen = higher pitch)
- **Horizontal position**: Controls stereo panning (left/right)
- **Corner positions**: Control which waveform is used:
  - Top-left corner: Sine wave (pure, soft tone)
  - Top-right corner: Square wave (retro video game sound)
  - Bottom-left corner: Sawtooth wave (buzzy, bright sound)
  - Bottom-right corner: Triangle wave (mellow, warm sound)
  - Center: A blend of all waveforms

**Educational value**:
- Cause and effect (position changes sound)
- Spatial awareness (high/low, left/right)
- Musical exploration and pitch recognition
- Sound experimentation

#### Volume Control
**Range**: 0% (silent) to 100% (maximum)
**Default**: 10% (quiet background tones)

**Recommended settings**:
- **0-10%**: Very subtle, non-distracting
- **20-40%**: Noticeable but not overwhelming
- **50-70%**: Clear audio feedback
- **80-100%**: Loud (may be overwhelming for sensitive children)

#### 🔇 Mute Audio Tones Checkbox
Turns off position-based tones completely while keeping speech enabled.

**When to mute**:
- Child is sensitive to electronic sounds
- You want to focus only on vocabulary learning
- Playing in a quiet environment (library, church, etc.)
- Bedtime or nap time learning

#### ⏱️ Tone Duration Control
**What it controls**: How long tones play before automatically stopping.

**Settings**:
- **Until Destroyed** (-1): Tones play continuously until object is removed
- **0.1-20 seconds**: Tones play for that duration then stop automatically

**Recommended settings**:
- **Until Destroyed**: For ambient musical play; creates evolving soundscapes
- **100-500ms**: Quick "bleep" sounds on spawn
- **1-3 seconds**: Brief musical feedback
- **5-10 seconds**: Sustained but not permanent tones
- **20 seconds**: Long tones for musical exploration

**Why you might want shorter durations**:
- Prevent audio chaos with many objects
- Create cleaner, less cluttered sound environment
- Focus attention on speech instead of tones
- Reduce sensory overload

### 🗣️ Speech Voice (Words & Labels)

**What it is**: The spoken words that announce each object's name in enabled languages.

**How it works**:
- When an object appears, ToddleToy speaks its name
- Speaks in all enabled languages in order
- Uses your device's built-in text-to-speech engine
- Different voices for different languages

**Educational value**:
- **Primary learning method**: Hearing vocabulary is essential
- Language acquisition through repetition
- Pronunciation modeling
- Multi-language exposure

#### Volume Control
**Range**: 0% (silent) to 100% (maximum)
**Default**: 70% (clear and prominent)

- **70-90%**: Louder for noisy environments
- **30-50%**: Quieter for sensitive hearing
- **100%**: Maximum clarity (use in very loud environments only)

#### 🔇 Mute Speech Checkbox
Turns off all spoken words.

**When to mute speech**:
- Silent reading practice
- Visual-only learning
- Very quiet environments where sound would disturb others
- Child has auditory sensitivities

**Note**: Muting speech significantly reduces educational value, as hearing words is a primary learning mechanism.

#### 🎤 Speech Speed Control
**What it controls**: How fast the computer voice speaks.

**Settings**:
- **0.25x**: Very slow, careful pronunciation
- **0.5x**: Slow, deliberate speech
- **0.75x**: Slightly slower than normal
- **1.0x**: Normal speaking speed (default)

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Starting Out (First Time Users)
1. **Install the app** for the safest experience
2. **Start with 1-2 content types** enabled (e.g., just shapes and emojis)
3. **Use 1-2 languages** your family speaks
4. **Keep default weights** until you see what your child likes
5. **Play together** - guide exploration and celebrate discoveries

### After a Few Sessions
1. **Adjust weights** based on what engages your child
2. **Add content types** gradually to maintain interest
3. **Experiment with languages** - children absorb more than you think!
4. **Try special number displays** for older children (3-4+)

### For Multiple Children
- **Younger child**: More shapes, emojis, small numbers, fewer categories
- **Older child**: Add letters, large numbers, multiple languages, special number displays
- **Mixed ages**: Enable everything, use weights to balance (more shapes/emojis, fewer large numbers)

### Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Too overwhelming, too much happening
**Solution**:
- Reduce number of enabled content types
- Lower weights on less important categories
- Use only 1 language
- Disable special number displays
- Increase auto-cleanup timer or disable it

**Problem**: Child loses interest quickly
**Solution**:
- Add more variety (enable more content types)
- Increase weights on favorite categories
- Add a second language for novelty
- Enable special number displays for older kids
- Shorter auto-cleanup timer for faster pace

**Problem**: Wrong difficulty level
**Solution**:
- **Too easy**: Add letters, large numbers, multiple languages
- **Too hard**: Focus on shapes and emojis, use only small numbers (1-10), stick to one language

**Problem**: Audio issues
**Solution**:
- Adjust speech volume separately from audio tones
- Try slower speech speed (0.5x or 0.75x)
- Mute audio tones if they're distracting
- Check device volume settings
