# Toddler Toy Interactive System Design

## Overview

A multi-input, multilingual, Montessori-aligned toddler interaction toy in the form of a PWA web app. The child interacts with the screen using touch, mouse, keyboard, or gamepad. Interactions spawn visual elements such as colored shapes, emojis, colored letters, or colored numbers with accompanying spoken labels and dynamic sound/particle effects. The interface is responsive, non-violent, and focuses on sensorial learning.

**Supports liquid screen resolution and aspect ratio changes for desktop and mobile web.** The interface automatically adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring optimal readability and usability across all devices.

## Configuration System

The application now features a comprehensive configuration system that loads by default, allowing parents and educators to customize the learning experience for their specific needs.

### Accessing Configuration
- **Default Route**: Configuration screen loads automatically at `/` (root URL)
- **Admin Access**: Visit `/admin` to access configuration (bypasses skip setting)
- **Skip Option**: Users can choose to skip the config screen on subsequent visits

### üìö Complete Configuration Guide

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first, accessible interface

## Input Support

### Touch / Mouse

* Taps/clicks spawn an object at the interaction point.
* Drags move the current object.
* Multi-touch averages all points to determine the drag location.

### Keyboard

* Key press spawns object at a pre-mapped screen location.
* Holding multiple keys causes object to interpolate between locations.
* Releasing keys removes those from the interpolation average.

### Gamepad

* Joystick direction (averaged between both sticks) moves the object.
* Button press spawns new object and toggles drag state.
* Button held = continuous drag.

## Languages

* English (default)
* Spanish (enabled)
* Architecture supports easy addition of other languages.

## Display Format (each line should be horizontally centered relative to the next one, not left or right justified)

```
üü¶
Blue Square
Cuadro Azul
```

### Display Order (for numbers):

* Top: Cistercian numeral (font-based rendering)
* Next: Kaktovik numeral (Unicode font)
* Next: Binary (‚ù§Ô∏è for 1, ü§ç for 0)
* Main: Colored number
* Below: \[Color] \[Number] in English
* Bottom: \[Color] \[Number] in Spanish

#### Cistercian Numeral Font Implementation

The Cistercian numeral system uses the "Cistercian QWERTY" font to create compound glyphs representing numbers 0-9999. This implementation differs significantly from standard base-10 numbering systems:

**Key Principles:**
- **Base-1000 System**: Unlike decimal digits, Cistercian numerals combine multiple position-specific characters into single compound glyphs
- **Character Sequence Order**: Always start with the units digit and append higher positions (units‚Üítens‚Üíhundreds‚Üíthousands)
- **Zero Handling**: Only include '0' for the units position; omit zeros in tens, hundreds, and thousands positions
- **No Spaces**: Character sequences are concatenated directly without spaces or separators

**QWERTY Keyboard Mapping:**
```
Thousands: Z X C V B N M , . /  (for digits 1-9, 0)
Hundreds:  A S D F G H J K L ;  (for digits 1-9, 0)  
Tens:      Q W E R T Y U I O P  (for digits 1-9, 0)
Units:     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0  (for digits 1-9, 0)
```

**Character Generation Examples:**
- `5` ‚Üí '5' (units only)
- `23` ‚Üí '3w' (units '3' + tens 'w' for 2)
- `105` ‚Üí '5a' (units '5' + hundreds 'a' for 1, tens omitted)
- `1234` ‚Üí '4esz' (units '4' + tens 'e' + hundreds 's' + thousands 'z')
- `8814` ‚Üí '4qk,' (units '4' + tens 'q' + hundreds 'k' + thousands ',')

**Implementation Notes:**
- The font renders these character sequences as single compound glyphs
- Positioning is adjusted 20 pixels higher than base object position for optimal visual alignment
- Each number produces exactly one glyph regardless of character sequence length
- Character order is critical: incorrect ordering produces separate glyphs instead of compounds

**For Future Maintainers:**
- Never insert spaces in character sequences - this breaks glyph formation
- Always include the units digit even if it's zero
- Character mappings are fixed and correspond to physical QWERTY keyboard layout
- Test with the examples above to verify correct implementation

### Display Order (general):

* Main icon (emoji, shape, letter)
* Name in English
* Name in Spanish

### Letters

* Include upper and lowercase (e.g. Red A, Green a).
* Colored character shown.
* Word label matches color + letter.

## Speech Requirements

* Native Web Speech API `speechSynthesis`.
* Reads each word in selected languages.
* Highlights (animates) each word while reading.
* Queue locked until all words have been read.
* If interaction happens mid-read, object is moved rather than spawning a new one.

## Visual Effects

* Particle bursts when spawning.
* Trails or pulses during drag.
* Word-specific sparkle or highlight when read.

## Audio FX (Tone Generator)

* Use Web Audio API.
* Shape = blend of waveforms:

  * Top-left: Sine
  * Top-right: Square
  * Bottom-left: Sawtooth
  * Bottom-right: Triangle
* X/Y determines mix ratio.
* Pitch = vertical screen position.
* Volume = slightly lower than speech.
* Continuous background tone per interaction object.

## Object Types

### Emojis

* Carefully curated list of emojis a toddler would recognize.
* Animal, food, toy, vehicle, and face categories prioritized.

### Shapes

* Basic geometric shapes in bold primary/secondary colors.
* Label format: "Red Square", "Blue Triangle", etc.

### Letters

* A‚ÄìZ (upper and lowercase).
* Colored letters with matching word label.

### Numbers

* 0‚Äì9999.
* Frequency weight:

  * 0‚Äì20: most frequent
  * 21‚Äì1000: less frequent
  * 1001‚Äì9999: least frequent
* Multimodal representation (Cistercian, Kaktovik, Binary, Base-10)

## Rendering Technologies

* **Canvas or WebGL** via Phaser 3.
* Particle systems: use Phaser's built-in or integrate `particles.js`.
* Cistercian: font-based rendering using Cistercian QWERTY font with compound glyph formation.
* Kaktovik: Use Unicode font or custom fallback.
* Binary: Render above object with ‚ù§Ô∏è and ü§ç.

## Text & Labeling

* Rendered in Phaser text objects.
* Style: clear sans-serif, large, high contrast.
* Text highlights or pulses with each word spoken.
* Text animates in/out cleanly to reinforce the word.

## Layout

* **Liquid responsive design** adapts to any screen resolution and aspect ratio
* **Mobile-optimized** with touch-friendly interactions and safe area support
* **Desktop-optimized** with keyboard and mouse support
* **Cross-platform PWA** installable on Android, iOS, ChromeOS, and desktop
* **Automatic scaling** ensures readability on all devices from 320px to 1920px+
* **Orientation-aware** handles portrait/landscape changes smoothly
* **Anti-clipping protection** keeps all content visible within safe margins

```js
{
  emoji: "üêª",
  en: "Bear",
  es: "Oso",
  type: "emoji"
}
```

* Localized label mapping for shapes, letters, and numbers.
* Custom spawn frequency weights.
* Limit code files to 300 lines or less. If they grow more than that, please refactor.
