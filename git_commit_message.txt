feat: Improve routing and caching for smoother user experience

This commit addresses two key areas to enhance the application's user experience:

- **Optimized Client-Side Routing:**
  - Modified `src/routes/routes.js` to prevent unnecessary page refreshes
    by checking if the user is already on the target route before
    initiating a redirect. This reduces redundant navigations and
    improves perceived performance.

- **Enhanced Service Worker Caching Strategy:**
  - Updated `sw.js` to implement a "network-first" caching strategy
    specifically for navigation requests (e.g., `/`, `/admin`, `/toy`).
    This ensures that the latest version of `index.html` is always
    fetched from the network first, guaranteeing users receive the most
    up-to-date application code, while still providing offline fallback.
