## üéØ ACTIVE TASKS

### Phase 14: Numeral Positioning & Base System Fixes (High Priority) 

**Problem**: 
- Kaktovik numerals need to be positioned a few pixels higher (3-5 pixels above current position)
- Cistercian numerals need to be positioned even higher (5-10 pixels above current position) 
- Cistercian font system is incorrectly treating it as base-10 when it should be base-1000 (glyphs combine to form compound numerals)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Write failing test for improved Kaktovik numeral vertical positioning
- [ ] Adjust Kaktovik numeral Y offset in renderKaktovikNumeral function
- [ ] Write failing test for improved Cistercian numeral vertical positioning  
- [ ] Adjust Cistercian numeral Y offset in renderCistercianNumeral function

- [ ] Fix Cistercian numeral rendering to use proper base-1000 character combination logic
- [ ] Update component layout system to handle new positioning offsets
- [ ] Run tests to ensure positioning fixes work correctly
- [ ] Test visual alignment with browser testing

**Expected Outcome**: 
- Kaktovik numerals appear 3-5 pixels higher than current position
- Cistercian numerals appear 5-10 pixels higher than current position  
- Cistercian numerals properly combine glyphs for compound numbers (e.g., "1qdb 2grm" creates two combined glyphs with space between)

### Phase 18: Code Refactoring (High Priority)

## üìù Notes

- Following TDD: Write failing test first, implement minimal code to pass, commit, repeat
- Each feature tested independently
- Code files kept under 300 lines (VIOLATION: game.js=2640, ConfigScreen.js=1864, ConfigManager.js=397)
- Need to develop an optional "Grid" mode that makes a grid (larger or smaller depending on screen size) with an array of things for the baby to poke and make voice. Things don't move in grid mode. Must discuss.
- Frequent commits with clear messages
- All tests passing ‚úÖ
- Ready for core functionality deployment, enhancement phases in progress

**üéØ Current Focus**: Code refactoring and numeral positioning fixes are the highest priority tasks to tackle next.
