### Phase 11: Enhanced Speech Interaction (High Priority) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Write failing test for revoice on click functionality

### Phase 12: Layout Preservation Fix (High Priority) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Investigate layout positioning regression where moving objects breaks internal alignment
- [x] Write comprehensive layout preservation tests
- [x] Attempt initial fix with offset-based positioning system
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Identified legacy positioning conflict causing word overlaps
- [x] **RESOLVED**: Disabled legacy label positioning when componentLayout exists
- [x] Issue resolved: Word spacing now preserved perfectly across all object movements

### Phase 13: Comprehensive Layout Fix with Browser Testing (High Priority) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Problem**: Words overlapping after object movement due to legacy positioning conflict
**Solution**: "ComponentLayout System" - disable legacy positioning when new layout system exists to prevent conflicts

#### Phase 13.1: Browser-Based Testing Infrastructure ‚úÖ
- [x] Install Playwright for actual browser testing
- [x] Setup visual regression testing with screenshots  
- [x] Create spawn ‚Üí move ‚Üí verify test workflow
- [x] Test specific regression cases: "Red Triangle" ‚Üí "Orange Q"

#### Phase 13.2: Enhanced Unit Testing ‚úÖ
- [x] Improve test mocking with realistic text width calculations
- [x] Include responsive scaling factors in test setup
- [x] Test edge cases: long phrases, numbers with all displays
- [x] Add regression tests for specific user-reported cases

#### Phase 13.3: Core Implementation Fix ‚úÖ
- [x] Store relative component positions during spawn (`obj.componentLayout`)
- [x] Replace hardcoded `y + 60`, `y + 90` with stored relative positions
- [x] Update `setObjectPosition` to use locked component relationships
- [x] Ensure atomic movement of all components as cohesive unit
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Fixed timing issue - moved `displayTextLabels` inside `spawnObjectAt` 
- [x] **SOLUTION**: ComponentLayout now stores spawn-position offsets, not keyboard-position offsets
- [x] **FINAL FIX**: Disabled legacy label positioning when componentLayout exists to prevent conflicts

#### Phase 13.4: Browser Validation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Automated Playwright tests with real browser interaction
- [x] Visual screenshot comparison before/after movement  
- [x] Performance validation with multiple objects
- [x] Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile)

#### Phase 13.5: Documentation & Cleanup ‚úÖ
- [x] Document "center-based offset storage" system in code comments
- [x] Update test coverage documentation in todo list
- [x] Remove debug logging after successful fix verification

### Phase 14: Numeral Positioning & Base System Fixes (High Priority) 

**Problem**: 
- Kaktovik numerals need to be positioned a few pixels higher (3-5 pixels above current position)
- Cistercian numerals need to be positioned even higher (5-10 pixels above current position) 
- Cistercian font system is incorrectly treating it as base-10 when it should be base-1000 (glyphs combine to form compound numerals)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Write failing test for improved Kaktovik numeral vertical positioning
- [ ] Adjust Kaktovik numeral Y offset in renderKaktovikNumeral function
- [ ] Write failing test for improved Cistercian numeral vertical positioning  
- [ ] Adjust Cistercian numeral Y offset in renderCistercianNumeral function
- [ ] Write failing test for proper Cistercian base-1000 glyph combination
- [ ] Fix Cistercian numeral rendering to use proper base-1000 character combination logic
- [ ] Update component layout system to handle new positioning offsets
- [ ] Run tests to ensure positioning fixes work correctly
- [ ] Test visual alignment with browser testing

**Expected Outcome**: 
- Kaktovik numerals appear 3-5 pixels higher than current position
- Cistercian numerals appear 5-10 pixels higher than current position  
- Cistercian numerals properly combine glyphs for compound numbers (e.g., "1qdb 2grm" creates two combined glyphs with space between)

### Notes

- Following TDD: Write failing test first, implement minimal code to pass, commit, repeat
- Each feature tested independently
- Code files kept under 300 lines
- Need to develop an optional "Grid" mode that makes a grid (larger or smaller depending on screen size) with an array of things for the baby to poke and make voice. Things don't move in grid mode.Must discuss.
- Frequent commits with clear messages
- All tests passing ‚úÖ
- Ready for core functionality deployment, enhancement phases in progress
- User wants to flesh out and implement: We need a configureation screen, but I' not sure how I want it to work yet, but it should have some sort of differnt age ranges that reveal different things (youngest maybe omits numbers, or only shows 0-10, and uses numbers of common obejects to encourage counting instead of binary - might still include kartovic, might not too, also maybe lowercase letters aren't introduced until a later age - later ages maybe unlock even more emojis, of more sophisticated and less familiar things.
