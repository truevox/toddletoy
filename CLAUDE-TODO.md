- Cistercian numerals need to be positioned even higher (5-10 pixels above current position) 
- Cistercian font system is incorrectly treating it as base-10 when it should be base-1000 (glyphs combine to form compound numerals)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Write failing test for improved Kaktovik numeral vertical positioning

### Notes

- Following TDD: Write failing test first, implement minimal code to pass, commit, repeat
- Each feature tested independently
- Code files kept under 300 lines (VIOLATION: game.js=2640, ConfigScreen.js=1864, ConfigManager.js=397)
- Need to develop an optional "Grid" mode that makes a grid (larger or smaller depending on screen size) with an array of things for the baby to poke and make voice. Things don't move in grid mode.Must discuss.
- Frequent commits with clear messages
- All tests passing ‚úÖ
- Ready for core functionality deployment, enhancement phases in progress
- User wants to flesh out and implement: We need a configureation screen, but I' not sure how I want it to work yet, but it should have some sort of differnt age ranges that reveal different things (youngest maybe omits numbers, or only shows 0-10, and uses numbers of common obejects to encourage counting instead of binary - might still include kartovic, might not too, also maybe lowercase letters aren't introduced until a later age - later ages maybe unlock even more emojis, of more sophisticated and less familiar things.

- [ ] Implement import/export functionality for family data backup
- [ ] Add photo-as-spawnable-object integration with existing game engine
- [ ] Ensure speech synthesis reads family member names correctly
- [ ] Add privacy controls and data deletion options

#### Phase 25.2: Custom Unicode Emoji Feature

#### Phase 25.3: Advanced Family Features
- [ ] Add relationship labels (Mom, Dad, Grandpa, etc.) with multilingual support
- [ ] Implement family member grouping (immediate family, extended family, friends)
- [ ] Create family tree visualization mode
- [ ] Add voice recording for family member names (parents can record pronunciations)
- [ ] Implement age-appropriate family member filtering
- [ ] Add family story mode (sequence family members in stories)

#### Phase 25.4: Data Management & Privacy

- **Custom Content**: Parents can add culturally relevant emojis and family photos
- **Privacy First**: All family data stored locally with optional encrypted backup
- **Extensible System**: Framework supports adding custom visual content beyond family photos
- **Educational Value**: Reinforces family relationships, names, and personal identity development

### Notes

- Following TDD: Write failing test first, implement minimal code to pass, commit, repeat
- Each feature tested independently
- Code files kept under 300 lines (VIOLATION: game.js=2640, ConfigScreen.js=1864, ConfigManager.js=397)
- Need to develop an optional "Grid" mode that makes a grid (larger or smaller depending on screen size) with an array of things for the baby to poke and make voice. Things don't move in grid mode.Must discuss.
- Frequent commits with clear messages
- All tests passing ‚úÖ
- Ready for core functionality deployment, enhancement phases in progress
