## Project Implementation Plan

This document tracks the structured implementation of the toddler-toy PWA following TDD principles.

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (High Priority) âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] Set up basic project structure with index.html, package.json, and Phaser 3
- [x] Write failing test for spawning a single object at touch/click point
- [x] Implement basic object spawning at interaction point
- [x] Write failing test for speech synthesis of object labels
- [x] Implement Web Speech API for speaking object labels

### Phase 2: Visual & Input Systems (Medium Priority) âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] Write failing test for displaying bilingual text labels
- [x] Implement text display with English/Spanish labels
- [x] Write failing test for keyboard input handling
- [x] Implement keyboard input support
- [x] Write failing test for Web Audio API tone generation
- [x] Implement Web Audio API tone generation based on position

### Phase 3: Visual Effects (Low Priority) âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] Write failing test for particle effects on spawn
- [x] Implement particle effects using Phaser

### Phase 4: Advanced Input & PWA âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] Write failing test for gamepad input handling
- [x] Implement gamepad input support
- [x] Add PWA manifest and service worker for offline capability

### Completed Tasks âœ…

**Core Foundation:**
- Project structure with Vite, Phaser 3, Jest testing
- Object spawning at touch/click points with random emojis
- Web Speech API for bilingual (English/Spanish) speech synthesis
- Sequential speech playback with proper language codes

**Visual & Audio Systems:**
- Bilingual text display below spawned objects
- Keyboard input with 3x3 grid layout (QWEASDZXC keys)
- Web Audio API tone generation:
  - Y-position determines frequency (200-800Hz)
  - Screen quadrants determine waveform (sine/square/sawtooth/triangle)
  - 3-second auto-stop with cleanup

**Visual Effects:**
- Colorful particle burst effects on spawn
- 8-particle circular pattern with random colors
- Tweened fade-out animations with automatic cleanup

**Advanced Features:**
- Gamepad input with dual-stick averaging and deadzone handling
- PWA functionality with offline capability and app installation
- Service worker for resource caching and background sync support
- Cross-platform compatibility (Android, iOS, ChromeOS, desktop)

### Current Status ðŸŽ¯ PROJECT COMPLETE!

**Fully functional interactive experience with:**
- Touch/click, keyboard, and gamepad interactions
- Bilingual speech synthesis (English/Spanish)
- Position-based audio tones with multiple waveforms
- Visual particle effects and text display
- PWA installation and offline functionality
- Comprehensive test coverage (30 tests across 7 suites)

### Notes

- Following TDD: Write failing test first, implement minimal code to pass, commit, repeat
- Each feature tested independently
- Code files kept under 300 lines
- Frequent commits with clear messages
- All tests passing âœ…
- Ready for deployment and app store submission
